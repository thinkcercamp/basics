ThinkCERCAMP
========================================================================================

# Purpose
To create a space to learn web development skills, for learners of all experience levels.

# How it works
This repository is structured with learning modules. Each of the modules is designed to be completed independently. We recommend starting with Module 0, but you are free to start whereever you'd like. Modules 0-3 are designed to walk you through building out an online portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages.
Each Friday at 12pm Central time we will provide a space for you to work through the modules with developers. Join #thinkcercamp on slack for the latest.
